# Board Game Rental

This is the final project from Kodilla JAVA developer plus bootcamp - a REST API for renting boardGames.
Of course I don't realy have Boardgames to rent ;P

This is a **multi-module** project - so while checking coverage one package should be excluded from coverage scope.
The said package is vaadin (which is only in frontend module and do not contain any business logic but only views 
created in, you guessed, vaadin. Hence, I thought that it is pointless for it to be in tests coverage).

To run this app you should run the main method in **GameBoardRentalApplication** class that is in **Module Frontend**

I thought about adding authentication, but the deadline came way to close to implement it on time, however the project 
**will be** polished further (but at slower pace, as I want to create another project at the same time) after turning it in, 
so if you feel like it don't hesitate to  check later commits.

The commit this project was turned in is:
The current (hopefully upgraded) version is of course without commit identifier that is: https://github.com/Bauaser-kun/BoardGameRentalEngine
