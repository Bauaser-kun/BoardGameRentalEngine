# Board Game Rental

This is the final project from Kodilla JAVA developer plus bootcamp - a REST API for renting boardGames.
Of course I don't realy have Boardgames to rent ;P

This is a **multi-module** project - so while checking coverage one package should be excluded from coverage scope.
The said package is vaadin (which is only in frontend module and do not contain any business logic but only views 
created in, you guessed, vaadin. Hence, I thought that it is pointless for it to be in tests coverage scope).
The tests also are all created in one module.
There is also commented PopulateDatabaseWithSampleData class in module tests which is used to fill database with some data 
to make possible frontend checks.

To run this app you should run the main method in **GameBoardRentalApplication** class that is in **Module Frontend**

The commit this project was turned in the state from commit: https://github.com/Bauaser-kun/BoardGameRentalEngine/commit/c215d36583bb2ae263ab72d1bfa7a43e7e6b8aec
(If you are the one who will evaluate my prohect the actual commit you got link to is one commit later, and it consists only of updating link above)

I thought about adding authentication, but the deadline came way to close to implement it on time, however the project
**will be** polished further after turning it in (but at slower pace, as I want to create another project at the same time),
so if you feel like it don't hesitate to  check later commits.

The current (hopefully when you check it already upgraded) version is of course without commit identifier: https://github.com/Bauaser-kun/BoardGameRentalEngine
It will always be a stable commit - if something does not build I'm not going to commit it to this repository


~~if you entered via my github repositories, or googled it or simply deleted commit identifier after checking it then probably you're already here XD.~~
